We have good reason to suspect that this is a fraudulent investment platform, created to defraud the public of their payment information, credentials, and money.

Fake investment platforms impersonate legitimate investment platforms offering the chance to trade in foreign currencies (forex), contracts for difference (CFD), and/or other commodities in order to defraud consumers. These websites are used by fraudsters to deceive victims into transferring large sums of money which will supposedly be invested and provide guaranteed returns with little or no risk. After the victim has transferred enough money, the fraudster will cut off contact and the victim will not be able to recover any of the money they have transferred.

The promotion of financial services is subject to regulation in many countries. For example sections 12DA, 12DB, 12DF, and 12BB of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act (ASIC) 2001 outline that a person, in the course of trade or commerce, must not engage in misleading conduct or make misleading representations in connection with the promotion of financial services.

Fraudulent Investment websites contravene laws such as the ASIC Act due to their inherent misleading nature in respect of financial products. Several characteristics may be present to help confirm the site's fraudulent nature, including but not limited to the following:
* Promises of guaranteed, recurring high returns on investments. Legitimate investment platforms (such as eToro.com) do not promise guaranteed returns and display warnings that there is a risk of losing your money
* Different "investment plans" or "account types" which offer higher returns on investments if more money is deposited
* Emphasis that investments are safe because it is a registered company, for example by displaying a certificate of registration. These details are stolen from legitimate companies or forged.
* Claims that the company is authorised by one or more regulatory agencies, such as the UK's FCA or Australia's ASIC, when no such authorisation exists. This may include misuse of the regulatory agency's logo or seal.
* No phone number listed, or phone number is re-used on other fraudulent sites
* Website claims the company has many years of investment experience, but site is recently registered
* Fake testimonials about people successfully making money from the site (searching for the testimonials reveals other comparison sites using the same text)

Please remove this fraudulent content, and any other associated fraudulent content, as soon as possible.
